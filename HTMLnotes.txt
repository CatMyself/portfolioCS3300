HTML Notes

	HTML elements:

An HTML element is everything that goes inbetween 2 HTML tags.
Tags are pieces of markup language that can be used to describe the formatting of the contents within them

for example
<h1> (Some content) </h1>	This formats a header

<p1> (Some more content) </p1>	This formats a paragragh under a header

<br>	(This is an open element, which has no body or closing tag)	a break in the text


These elements can be nested, and in fact the <HTML> and </HTML> tags are used to define an HTML document, everthing else being nested in the body of this header


	Lists in HTML:

Some tags denote a list:

<UL> </UL> describe an unordered list, and <OL> </OL> for an ordered list (Which are numbered)
in an ordered or unordered list, <LI> </LI> describes one element of that list

A descriptive list is denoted by <DL> and </DL>
nested in a descriptive list are the the defined terms <dt> </dt>, and immediately following a term you can further describe a defined term with a <dd> </dd> tag.


	Hyperlinks in HTML:
the tags <a> and </a> describe an HTML hyperlink, a link that leads to some other document

<a href ="SomeURL">   (body part of tag) </a>

here, the value given to href is the destination URL from clicking on the body of the tag, which is what is displayed to the user.

additionally, you can define the target in the tag, which will define how the tag opens up this new link
<a href = "url.com" target = (target)> "This is the body of my message" </a>

where (target) can be _self, _parent, _top, or _blank, which describes how the window is opened




	HTML Forms:
Forms are elements that allow users to input information to be processed by the server






	Bootstrap containers:

a container in bootstrap is the most basic layout element of bootstrap

they are accessed with the class selector

(copied from a tutorial website)
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/layout/containers/
<div class="container-sm">100% wide until small breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-md">100% wide until medium breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-lg">100% wide until large breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-xl">100% wide until extra large breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-xxl">100% wide until extra extra large breakpoint</div>

	Bootstrap lists:
a bootstrap list is a sort of class that can be invoked on html's list elements
<ul class="list-group">
<li class="list-group-item" some item </li>
</ul>

A dropdown menu is sort of another version of a list, except that it only shows
up when it is clicked
there are certain guidlines and standards about what kind of content should be in 
certain kinds of contextual menus on web pages, to increase readabiliy/accesibility of the content
(from same website)
<div class="dropdown">
  <button class="btn btn-secondary dropdown-toggle" type="button" data-bs-toggle="dropdown" aria-expanded="false">
    Dropdown button
  </button>
  <ul class="dropdown-menu">
    <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Action</a></li>
    <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Another action</a></li>
    <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Something else here</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
